# check-password

This is a small command tool for checking with haveibeenpwned database whether your password is compromised or not. If you want to check you password you should:

1. Don't trust anyone from the Internet. You should not enter your password in places that you don't trust. Even this script!
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/life777/check-password.git`
3. Go inside `cd check-password`
4. Take a look at code in `check.py` file and make sure that you can trust it. If it looks suspicious or you see an issue, don't use it and onpe an issue on GitHub. 
5. Run this command `python check.py {YOUR_PASSWORD}`

Thanks a lot
